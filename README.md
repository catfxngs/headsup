# Heads Up!
Up-to-date watch, warning, and advisory messages for a selected location using the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

*Very much still a work in progress, sorry for messy code!*

## Current Features

- Choose a coordinate to watch for alerts
- Pushes a notification if a new alert is found (not tested on macOS)
- Customize the time between checking for new alerts
- Click on an alert in the app for more details

## Known Issues

When an [alert expires or falls off, the app tends to crash.](https://github.com/spikeyscout/headsup/issues/1)

Improper coordinates cause the app to crash. This is due to it not being handled, will be added soon.
