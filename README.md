# headsup
uses the national weather service's api to give you up-to-date watch, warning, and advisory messages for a selected location.

very much still a work in progress. i'm still not that good at python, sorry if the code is a mess.

current features:

- choose a coordinate to watch for alerts
- pushes a notification if a new alert is found (not tested on macOS)
- customize the time between checking for new alerts
- click on an alert in the app for more details

A notification about the Avalanche Warning can be seen in the corner.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spikeyscout/headsup/2b2ad11f2dc583d69bde8a0b6c8b356fc77b4a82/img/img1.png)
